##We are the Global Seagrass Monitoring Network

    SeagrassNet is an expanding, worldwide ecological monitoring program that investigates and documents the status of seagrass resources and the threats to this important and imperilled marine ecosystem. The program started in 2001 in the Western Pacific and now includes 126 sites in 33 countries with a global monitoring protocol and web-based data reporting system. Our ultimate aim is to preserve the valuable seagrass ecosystem by increasing scientific knowledge and public awareness of this threatened coastal resource.
