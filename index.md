SeagrassNet is an expanding, worldwide research program that investigates and documents the status of seagrass resources and the threats to this important and imperiled marine ecosystem. The program started in 2001 in the Western Pacific and now includes 126 sites in 33 countries with a global monitoring protocol and web-based data reporting system. SeagrassNet has now transitioned to leadership by the Smithsonian Institution's MarineGEO program. Our ultimate aim is to preserve valuable seagrass ecosystems by increasing scientific knowledge and public awareness of this threatened coastal resource.
